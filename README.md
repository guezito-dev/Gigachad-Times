## Overview 

This repository contains a static web dashboard for visualizing interactions among "Abstract Giga Chads" on the Ethos Network. It includes two main pages:

- Daily Recap: A summary view of recent activities, top rankings, new users, rank changes, invitations, and users with missing profile IDs.
- Gigachad Leaderboard: A full interactive table with sorting, search, and detailed user modals showing activities and missing reviews.

The dashboard fetches data from GitHub-hosted JSON files (generated by separate scripts) and the Ethos API. It's styled in a vintage newspaper theme, fully responsive, and includes caching for improved performance.

## Features 

### Daily Recap Page (`index.html`):

- Recent vouches and reviews with avatars, timestamps, stake amounts, and links.
- Top 5 leaderboard.
- Daily rank changes (top point gainers).
- Newest Gigachads with join times and profile links.
- Gigachads with available invitations, linked to X profiles.
- Modal listing users without profile IDs, with avatars and X links.

### Leaderboard Page (`table/index.html`):

- Full ranked table with sortable columns (rank, vouches/reviews given/received, total score).
- Search bar with autocomplete and highlighting.
- User details modal showing given/received activities.
- Per-user modal for missing reviews (Gigachads not yet reviewed/vouched).

### Shared Features:

- Responsive design for mobile/desktop.
- LocalStorage caching with expiry.
- Tooltips for ranking system.
- Loading states, error handling, and empty states.
- Clickable links to Ethos profiles, X (Twitter), and activities.
- Vintage animations and hover effects (optimized for mobile).

Data is updated via external JSON files; no server needed.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- Internet access for fetching JSON data from GitHub and Ethos API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/guezito-dev/Ethos.git
```
```
cd Ethos
```
2. No dependenciesâ€”pure HTML/CSS/JS.

## Usage

### 1. Daily Recap: Open `index.html`.

- Views load automatically with caching.
- Click "Missing IDs" for the modal.
- Hover over "Ranking System" for tooltip.


### 2. Gigachad Leaderboard: Open `table/index.html`.

- Sort by clicking headers.
- Search users via the input.
- Click "MISSING" for missing reviews modal.

Debug Mode: Set `DEBUG_MODE = false` in JS to disable logs.

## Key Files

- `index.html`: Structure for daily recap.
- `daily-recap.css`: Styles for daily recap (vintage, responsive).
- `daily-recap.js`: Logic for data fetch, render, cache, modals on daily recap.
- `table/index.html`: Structure for leaderboard.
- `table/table.css`: Styles for leaderboard table/modals.
- `table/table.js`: Logic for sorting, search, activities, modals on leaderboard.

## Data Sources

- GitHub JSON files: `gigachads-ranking.json`, `activities-data.json`, `new-gigachads-data.json`, `invitations-data.json`, `rank-changes-data.json` (generated by separate Node.js scripts).
- Ethos Network API: For profile details, activities, and invitations.

## Scoring System

Points are calculated as follows (displayed in a tooltip on hover):

- Vouch Given: 10 points
- Vouch Received: 5 points
- Review Given: 2 points
- Review Received: 1 point

Higher activity leads to higher ranks.

## Limitations

- Static Nature: Relies on pre-generated JSON files; run backend scripts to update data.
- API Dependencies: Fetching from Ethos API may hit rate limits; includes basic error handling.
- Caching: Uses localStorage with a 5-minute expiry; clear browser cache if issues arise.
- Avatars: Falls back to placeholders if images fail to load.
- Mobile Optimizations: Reduced animations on mobile for performance.
