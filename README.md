## Overview 

This repository contains a static web dashboard built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to visualize daily recaps of interactions among "Abstract Giga Chads" on the Ethos Network. It fetches data from GitHub-hosted JSON files (generated by backend scripts) and the Ethos API, displaying leaderboards, recent activities (vouches and reviews), new users, rank changes, invitations, and users with missing profile IDs.
The dashboard is designed in a vintage newspaper style, responsive for mobile and desktop, and includes interactive elements like clickable items and a modal for detailed views.

## Features 

- **Recent Vouches and Reviews**: Displays the latest vouches and reviews with avatars, timestamps, and stake amounts (for vouches).
- **Top Leaderboard**: Shows the top 5 ranked Gigachads based on interaction points.
- **Rank Changes**: Lists top point gainers for the day or recent 24 hours.
- **New Gigachads**: Highlights the most recent users added, with join times and profile links.
- **Available Invitations**: Shows Gigachads with available invites, linked to their X profiles.
- **Missing Profile IDs Modal**: A button-triggered modal listing users without profile IDs, with avatars and X profile links.
- **Caching and Loading States**: Uses localStorage for caching rendered sections to improve load times; includes loading skeletons and error handling.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens with media queries.
- **Tooltips and Animations**: Includes a tooltip for the ranking system and subtle animations for updates and hovers.

Data is fetched from external JSON files on GitHub and the Ethos API, ensuring real-time-ish updates without a backend server.

## Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- No server requiredâ€”this is a static site; simply open index.html locally.
- Internet access for fetching JSON data from GitHub and Ethos API.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/guezito-dev/Ethos.git
```
```
cd Ethos
```

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in your web browser:
```open index.html  # On macOS```
```# Or double-click the file in your file explorer```

2. The dashboard will automatically load and render data:

- Fetches JSON from GitHub (e.g., activities, rankings, invitations).
- Uses caching for faster subsequent loads.
- Click the "Missing IDs" button to view users without profile IDs in a modal.
- Hover over the ranking system text for a tooltip explaining point calculations.


Debug Mode: Set DEBUG_MODE = false in daily-recap.js to disable console logging.

## Key Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure for the dashboard layout.
- `daily-recap.css`: Styles for the vintage newspaper theme, responsiveness, animations, and modal.
- `daily-recap.js`: JavaScript logic for fetching data, rendering sections, caching, and handling interactions (e.g., modals, clicks).

## Data Sources

- GitHub JSON files: `gigachads-ranking.json`, `activities-data.json`, `new-gigachads-data.json`, `invitations-data.json`, `rank-changes-data.json` (generated by separate Node.js scripts).
- Ethos Network API: For profile details, activities, and invitations.

## Scoring System

Points are calculated as follows (displayed in a tooltip on hover):

- Vouch Given: 10 points
- Vouch Received: 5 points
- Review Given: 2 points
- Review Received: 1 point

Higher activity leads to higher ranks.

## Limitations

- Static Nature: Relies on pre-generated JSON files; run backend scripts to update data.
- API Dependencies: Fetching from Ethos API may hit rate limits; includes basic error handling.
- Caching: Uses localStorage with a 5-minute expiry; clear browser cache if issues arise.
- Avatars: Falls back to placeholders if images fail to load.
- Mobile Optimizations: Reduced animations on mobile for performance.
